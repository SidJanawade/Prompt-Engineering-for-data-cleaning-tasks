# Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Google Gemini API to extract structured information from unstructured inputs like text, images, and PDF resumes.
The pipeline leverages prompt engineering to standardize outputs into JSON and convert them into usable formats like CSV.

# Features
- Extract structured JSON from free-text customer support logs.
- Detect urgency levels from text automatically.
- Parse invoices from images into structured JSON.
- Extract detailed fields (education, skills, projects, etc.) from PDF resumes.
- Save structured outputs into CSV files for further analysis.

# Tech Stack
- Python
- Google Generative AI (Gemini)
- dotenv for API key management
- pandas for data handling
